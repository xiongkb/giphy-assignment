# giphy-assignment
Intro:
Creating a dynamic website using the GIPHY API with js and jquery. The goal of this project was to learn and utilize apis
into my projects. I used a cat fact api from rapidapi.com ontop of giphy's api.

How to use:
1. Click on the premade buttons to show 10 generated gifs related to that subject.
2. You can add your own by typing in a word into the search box and add it to create a new button.
3. After you are done, you can click on the gifs to have it start playing.
4. Click again to stop it from animating.
5. Click on the cat box to generate a random fact about cats.
6. Enjoy!
